## Overview

The [Clean-Energy-Process (CEP) Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/clean-energy-processes/) is a laboratory, a.k.a., a research group, based at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) with research interests varying from experimental to modelling-based approaches to problem solving. This library aims to provide both a repository of Python-based models developed by the group as well as an open-access entry point for researchers, developers and product engineers to access some of the models developed within the group in an integrated holistic way. Further, the library strives to integrate some of the disperate models from within the group into a single easy-access model.

This functional specification (FS) document aims to outline the functionality which is expected of the library and of the models contained within it.

## Risks and assumptions

## Use cases

The `Technology-Library`, packaged as `ceplibrary`, aims to provide for several use cases:

1. An open-access, GitHub-hosted repository of Python-based models developed within the CEP Lab;
2. An interface for determining which components could fulfil a specific purpose within a system;
3. A series of open-access and peer-reviewed models of components which can be easily integrated with eachother and new models being developed in a simple "plug-and-play" style.
